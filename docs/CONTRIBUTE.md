# Contribute to AVH Booking System
If you want to contribute to the AVH-Booking System, please read the follwing guidelines first.

## Creating Issues
### General Info
- Make shure to include a good title and clear description.
- Sometimes we want to reach back to you. Be reachable.

### Did you find a bug?
- Please ensure the bug was not already reorted by searching the GitHub Issues.
- If you can't find an open issue adressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/maseiler/avh-booking-system/issues/new/choose).
- Please tell us how we can reproduce the error.

### Do you have a feature request?
- Please ensure the request or a similar one is not already existing in the GitHub Issues.
- If you find a corresponding Issue, feel free to comment on that.
- If you cannot find a open Issue to your Request [open a new one](https://github.com/maseiler/avh-booking-system/issues/new/choose).
- Be as accurate as you can be, but keep it as short as possible as well. 😅

## Did you write Code?
Do not write Code and send PRs without reaching out to us beforehand.
You can do this by commenting on existing Issues or creating new Issues.
- Every PR should have a corresponding Issue
- Every Code should come from a separate, issue related branch.
- Never write directly in version branches (master/development/v2).
- Every commit should have a clear message.
- The branch name should be prefixed with the branch you want to merge into followed by `-` and a CamelCase short Name for the corresponding Issue.

A branch including a Dark Mode for `v2` could be named like this:
```
v2-darkmodeTheme
```
